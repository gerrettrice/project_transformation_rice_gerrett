# Resources

* [A Complete Guide to Flexbox](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/)

I used this site to better understand flexbox, as I used it in my nav media query. As I explained in my Explanation.docx, this wasn't really necessary because of how the nav was initially constructed, but I got to get my feet wet with flexbox.

# Deductions

I reviewed the list of deductions for this project and in the syllabus.

# Comments

When I initially started this project, I went through the HTML and CSS and cleaned it up. I then saw the instruction to make focused changes and commits. Instead of starting over so I could log new commits, I cloned the starter files again and implemented the work I had already done as two separate commits.

Also, I started to restructure the page in accordance with the fourth part of the lecture. However,  that step wasn't stated in the instructions, so I stopped midway through that process as it was requiring I go back and manipulate the CSS again.
